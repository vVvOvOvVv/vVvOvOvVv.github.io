This portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. It includes:

- Interactive project cards with descriptions, images, and links
- Categorized skill sections with clickable skill icons
- Work experience and educational background

It serves both as a demonstration of my **front-end development skills** and as a professional presentation for recruiters or collaborators.

- **Custom Components**: Reusable Vue components like `ProjectBox`, `SkillsSubSection`, `ColoredText`, and `LinkBox`.
